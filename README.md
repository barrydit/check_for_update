### Don't copy this code without give me the credits, 
check_for_update is a tool to perform lookups / updates for JavaScript AJAX and frameworks/libraries. This will save time having to go to each library I use for future projects, to sure I have the most recent.

## Example:
This project is still in theory/works. So far I have some example libraries that I need to be updated quite frequently. The more I use, more the I will become dependent on this project succesfulness. Right now I use CSV to store relative information, and store successful updates in seperate directories.
