Semantic Versioning

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

    MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
    MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
    PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

Need to support multiple hosts / formats for which to check for 404 markers
	- If the next version is not available, check for MINOR (*.1.0) version change, if nothing, check for MAJOR change (1.0.0)
	- Possibly look for markers of versions, and possibly app/script name within the pathComponents

	- Rename $pathComponents / $pathComponents2 to readable values $path
